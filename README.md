Repository - Introductory Hub

Ijeoma here. I'm new to GitHub and computer programming in general. I heard data science is the future, so I started learning Python.  And since GitHub is THE hosting platform for programmers (so it seems), I figured I should become familiar with this space. Plus, I signed up to teach a technical Web Development class with IBM's P-Tech Mentorship program, so time to start learning. We'll see how all this goes in the end. ;) I'm excited.
